If more than one license agreement was provided for the Product, and the terms vary, the order of precedence of those license agreements is as follows: a signed agreement, a license agreement available for review on the Quest website, a printed or electronic agreement that states clearly that it supersedes other agreements, a printed agreement provided with the Product, an electronic agreement provided with the Product. Quest may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason. Quest may also terminate this Agreement if Licensee breaches any of its terms and conditions.
